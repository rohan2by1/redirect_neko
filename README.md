https://simple-chat-ccl0.onrender.com/ this one working from render.com also vercel domain also work



can i get domain for 57.159.29.115:8080 from vercel or render


Use a reverse proxy
Deploy a small proxy app on Vercel/Render that forwards requests to 57.159.29.115:8080. This way, Zscaler sees the trusted domain.
